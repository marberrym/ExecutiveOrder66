>> This is a GROUP collaboration with:

>> (aka the Legion of Doom)

Hidden Gem Atlanta is a front-end app developed with the purpose of promoting regionally unique businesses and locations.  The app is based on user generated content, where users can register with HGA then submit regionally unique retail businesses, venues, restaurants, or scenic locations.  Once a user chooses a location to submit, they are also able to provide a review and a rating based on 1-5 gems. 

Our app is aimed to help promote small businesses and overlooked locations.  We wanted an app that would aid a user who is on a short term visit to Atlanta.  We wanted that user to be able to connect with businesses and locations that Atlanta natives are passionate about.

### Before trying to run this project:

This project requires Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Auth and google/maps/image search API keys.  If you wish to run it, put your keys in a file named keys.js in the repo directory.  

### What problem motivated this app
Visitors or new residents of Atlanta may have a difficult time connecting with Atlanta-unique sites and businesses that the locals are passionate about.  We aim to connect these users with these businesses and locations.

### Technologies Used:
* Public Use API's for Firebase and Google.
* HTML5
* CSS3
* jQuery for AJAX fetch requests.
* JavaScript

#### Future Goals:
* Allow a user to create a wish list of locations they would like to visit and post on in the future.
* Optimize and refactor the code
* A loading spinner to be viewed while the google maps/images are rendered.
* Polish the styling of the website.
