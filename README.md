# Hidden Gem Atlanta (developed under codename: Order 66)

This project is a front end interface to accept a post (a gem) from a user. The gems are stored in firebase, and retrieved and displayed by to the visitor.

This is a GROUP collaboration with:
Nathan Reese
Matthew Marberry
Ian Gornall
(aka the Legion of Doom)

This project requires Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Auth, and google maps/search API keys. If you wish to run it, put your keys in keys.js and go to town!  (see what I did there? Cause it's about Atlanta)

# What problem motivated this app
A visitor to Atlanta will not know what unique sights/venues/etc the locals are passionate about. Plus they don't want to just wander idly around the city and get stabbed or accosted by our horde of zombies.

# Who are our users
Visitors to the area, curious to see the highlights of the city.
Residents of the city that want to share what makes Atlanta a GEM.


# Elevator pitch
You are in Atlanta only briefly, a visit or perhaps business.  Probably because you flew in here on your way someplace better. You want to know what to see here, and you want it from people who love the city, not some commercial crap.

# To Do
Wishlist items... It would be great to spend a minute on:
* Consistent Style
* Profit
* Optimize the code
* Image/map loading with google is slow... spinner?
* Matts background image is too big
* Check out the site load in Lighthouse and in the Network panel, fix fix fix
